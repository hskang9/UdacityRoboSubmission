    "**The goals / steps of this project are the following:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Training / Calibration**  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Download the simulator and take data in \"Training Mode\"\n",
    "* Test out the functions in the Jupyter Notebook provided\n",
    "* Add functions to detect obstacles and samples of interest (golden rocks)\n",
    "* Fill in the `process_image()` function with the appropriate image processing steps (perspective transform, color threshold etc.) to get from raw images to a map.  The `output_image` you create in this step should demonstrate that your mapping pipeline works.\n",
    "* Use `moviepy` to process the images in your saved dataset with the `process_image()` function.  Include the video you produce as part of your submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Autonomous Navigation / Mapping**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fill in the `perception_step()` function within the `perception.py` script with the appropriate image processing functions to create a map and update `Rover()` data (similar to what you did with `process_image()` in the notebook). \n",
    "* Fill in the `decision_step()` function within the `decision.py` script with conditional statements that take into consideration the outputs of the `perception_step()` in deciding how to issue throttle, brake and steering commands. \n",
    "* Iterate on your perception and decision function until your rover does a reasonable (need to define metric) job of navigating and mapping.  \n",

    "### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Writeup / README\n",

    "#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Okay!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebook Analysis\n",
    "#### 1. Run the functions provided in the notebook on test images (first with the test data provided, next on data you have recorded). Add/modify functions to allow for color selection of obstacles and rock samples.\n",
    "Here is an example of how to include an image in your writeup.\n",

Run `process_image()` on your test data using the `moviepy` functions provided to create video output of your result. \n",
    "\n",
    "I wrote a method hsv_thresh, utilising openCV range selection after converting the image to HSV colorspace for more precise color selection. I used color picker to find the brightet part and darkest part and made range out of them.\n",

    "\n",
    "'perception_step()' function takes charge of the robot's sense of location. It undergoes transforming the robot's vision into world coordinate and identifying obstacles, rocks, and terrain in image pixels by applying threshold of each of their RGB/HSV values. Then, the pixels of each object is tranformed into rover-centric coordinates, then world coordinate based on the robots position in the worldmap. The worldmap is updated based on the robot's position and orientation. \n",
    "the rover's navigation is determined by converting the rover-centric pixels of terrain into rover-centric polar coordinates. As a result, distances and angles for rovers to go can be generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "'decision_step()' function takes charge of the robot's action based on its state. \n",

    "#### 2. Launching in autonomous mode your rover can navigate and map autonomously.  Explain your results and how you might improve them in your writeup.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: running the simulator with different choices of resolution and graphics quality may produce different results, particularly on different machines!  Make a note of your simulator settings (resolution and graphics quality set on launch) and frames per second (FPS output to terminal by `drive_rover.py`) in your writeup when you submit the project so your reviewer can reproduce your results.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I'll talk about the approach I took, what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the pipeline might fail and how I might improve it if I were going to pursue this project further.  \n",

    "Increasing steering angle from 15 to 30 degrees enabled robot to quickly turn its projectory, resulting in faster movement throughout worldmap without getting stuck in rocks.\n",
